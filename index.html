                            <h3>Computing</h3>
                            <p>Computing has always <br>
                                Been a big part of my <br>
                                life and likely will be <br>
                                for the rest of it. <br>
                                Computing was one of <br>
                                my first interests as a boy<br>
                                and is the main reason this <br>
                                website itself exists.

                            <h3>Lifestyle</h3>
                            <p>My lifestyle is simple <br>
                                so simple in fact,<br>
                                that i can fit onto this small <br>
                                segment on my Homepage, I am <br>
                                in all sense of the word, very <br>
                                mediocre which you may already be able <br>
                                to tell from thes website design. <br>
                                my lifestyle is very much the same.
                                There really is not much to say on it<br>
                                other than the fact that i am introverted <br>
                                which is the main reason for my love of computers<br>
                                and that introversion allowed me to improve many <br>
                                skills in the IT sector and I'm hoping to expand <br>
                                on those skills by adding Coding.
